# 🚀 Autobill Studio - Invoice Generator SaaS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Autobill Studio is a **multi-tenant SaaS application** that enables companies to register and manage their **customers, goods/services, and invoices**. Each company operates in its own isolated scope, while the **Super Admin** has global visibility across the platform.

## ✨ Feature Workflow

1. **Company Registration & Login**
   - A company registers on the platform (**self-service**, no admin approval needed).
   - Login via **Google OAuth** or **Email + Password**.
   - After login, redirected to their **Invoice Dashboard**.

2. **Company Dashboard**
   - Manage **Customers** (add, update, delete, list).
   - Manage **Goods/Services** (add, update, delete, list).
   - Manage **Invoices**:
     - Create invoices  
     - View invoice details  
     - Download invoices as PDF  
     - Send invoices via email  

3. **Data Isolation**
   - Each company can only view and manage its own resources.

4. **Admin (SaaS Owner)**
   - Login via **Google OAuth** or **Email + OTP + Password**.
   - Has **global access** to all companies, customers, goods, and invoices.
   - Can monitor and manage all platform activities.
